It is possible to have an automatic setup for adding a native module to your project. Sometimes, a module may require a more complex setup. In such scenarios, you can use a config plugin to automatically configure your native project for a module and reduce the complexity by avoiding interaction with native project.

## What is a config plugin

Config plugin is a system for extending the [app config](/workflow/configuration) and customizing the [prebuild](/workflow/continuous-native-generation/) process of your app. They serve as a bridge between the JavaScript side of your app and the native Android and iOS platforms. Internally, Expo CLI uses config plugins to generate and configure all the native code for a project that is continuously generated (_previously known as_ a managed project).

## Why use config plugins

Config plugins are used to add native modules that aren't included by default or to add any native code that needs to be configured further. They can be used to generate app icons, set the app name, configure **AndroidManifest.xml** and **Info.plist**, and so on.

You can think of plugins like a bundler for native projects (**android** and **ios** directories) and running `npx expo prebuild` to bundle the projects by evaluating all project plugins. Doing so will generate **android** and **ios** directories. You can modify these directories manually after generating them, but then you cannot regenerate them safely without potentially overwriting manual modifications.
