When using a [Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](/workflow/continuous-native-generation/) project, you might want to implement native project (**android** and **ios** directories) changes without directly interacting with the native project files. In such scenarios, you can use a config plugin to automatically configure your native project.

## What is a config plugin

Config plugins let you add custom configuration points that are not already built into the [app config](/workflow/configuration). These custom configuration can modify the native projects created during the [prebuild](/workflow/continuous-native-generation/#usage) process in CNG projects.

## Why use a config plugin

Config plugins can add native configuration to your project that isn't included by default. They can be used to generate app icons, set the app name, configure **AndroidManigest.xml** and **Info.plist**, and so on.

Generally, in CNG projects, it is best to avoid modifying these native projects manually because you cannot regenerate them safely without potentially overwriting manual modifications. Config plugins allows you to modify these native projects in a _predictable way_ by keeping track of the changes you made to the native projects and only applying them when you run `npx expo prebuild` (either manually or automatically during a CI/CD process). For example, when you change the name of your app in app config and run `npx expo prebuild`, the name will change in your native projects automatically without the need to manually update **AndroidManifest.xml** and **Info.plist** files.
